Background

This project is intended to create a questionnaire to collect information about a patient's symptoms and suggest an action for thepatient to take (for example, booking a digital appointment with one of our doctors. To collect this information, we ask the patient a series of questions. Depending on the answer to each question, a new question will be shown until we reach a conclusion about what action to suggest to the patient.

● The application should read questions, answers and outcomes from the JSON.

● The application should start with the first question in the list.

● The patient’s score starts at 0.

● Each question contains a list of possible answers (exactly 2 per question). Answers have “id”, “label” (text to put on the button) and “score” (a number to be added to the current score for the patient).


Requirements

● As a user, I can navigate the questionnaire in a UI.

● As a user, I can navigate back and forth in the questionnaire.

● As a user, after answering all the questions, I am presented with suggested actions to take.

● As a user that has completed the questionnaire, I can restart the questionnaire and take it again.

● As a user, I can visualise the progress of the questionnaire as I answer the questions.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
